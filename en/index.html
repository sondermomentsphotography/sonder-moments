      <p class="f5-large" id="main-text">Welcome to my world of videography and photography. You’ve found your very own
        wedding bestie—who just so happens to carry a camera and an unhealthy obsession with confetti cannons! <br><br>
        I’ve worked in front of a lens myself, so I fully understand you. Suddenly, you’re painfully aware of your
        hands. What do you do with them? Are they too big? Too small? Why are they just hanging there like that? Don’t
        worry—I get it! My mission is to make you feel relaxed, comfortable, and absolutely fabulous because that’s when
        the magic happens. And by magic, I mean those moments where you laugh so hard you can’t stop, or tear up because
        someone made that speech. <br><br> Your wedding day isn’t just about love (although, yes, it’s mostly about
        love). It’s also the most epic party of your life! There’s dancing, cake, and someone inevitably shouting, “Who
        ordered the shots?!” I’m there to capture all of it—the romance, the chaos, the moments you didn’t even know
        were happening—so that you can relive it all, over and over again. <br><br> My goal? To create memories so
        stunning and joy-filled that every time you look back at your photos or watch your wedding film, you’ll smile.
        Or cry. Or both….out of happiness of course (Tissues are not included, by the way, but highly recommended.) <br><br>
        Let’s create something truly magical, shall we?</p>

      <p class="f5-large" id="photography-text">Let’s Make Your Love Shine (Without the Awkward Posing)! <br><br>
        Weddings are absolutely brilliant, aren’t they? The laughter, the happy tears, the “don’t trip over your dress”
        moments—it’s a day packed with all the feels. And my job? To capture every single bit of it, as naturally and
        effortlessly as your love. <br><br>
        Now, let me tell you what I won’t do: I won’t make you stand there like
        statues, trying to pull off some overly romantic pose while thinking, “Is my arm supposed to bend this way?”
        Instead, I’ll give you fun little prompts and actions that spark genuine smiles, proper belly laughs, and sweet
        moments you didn’t even know were happening. I will guide you and help you but only in a way that makes you feel
        totally amazing about the two of you. <br><br>
        The result? Gorgeous, frame-it-this-instant images that make you
        go, “Look at us! We’re fabulous!” <br><br>
        Here’s the thing: every couple is different. Some of you are all
        about the grand romance, some of you are big on the party vibes, and some of you just want to get to the cake
        cutting as quickly as possible. That’s why I’ve put together packages to suit every style, vibe, and budget.
        Wedding day coverage starts at €1450. So, sound like your kind of photographer? Get in touch! Download below my
        wedding brochure and pricing where you'll find all the juicy details on packages, pricing, and how we can make
        some photo magic together. <br><br>
        Let’s capture your day in a way that’s totally, brilliantly you.</p>

      <p class="f5-large" id="videography-text">The Wedding Film You’ll Wish You Had! <br><br> Let’s fast forward a few
        years. You’re snuggled up with your partner, cup of tea or coffee in hand, watching your wedding day unfold on
        screen. The laughter, the tears, the dodgy dance moves—yes, you did do the robot during the first dance, and
        yes, it somehow worked. It’s all there, beautifully captured in a way that makes you feel everything all over
        again. <br><br> Now, let’s rewind for a moment because here’s what I hear all the time: “Our biggest regret is
        not having a wedding film.” Honestly, it’s the number one thing couples tell me. And I get it—on the day, you’re
        thinking about the cake, the flowers, and making sure Grandma doesn’t sneak the centrepiece into her handbag
        (again). But trust me, you’ll wish you had those moments on film. <br><br> And here’s the thing—wedding videos
        used to be dull. I mean, we’ve all suffered through one of those four-hour epics, haven’t we? The ones where
        you’re stuck watching every single second: the bride putting on her shoes in real time, the groom awkwardly
        adjusting his tie, and a speech so long you start wondering if the clock’s broken. By the end, you’re
        practically begging for credits to roll. <br><br> Well, not on my watch! I create wedding films that are short,
        snappy, and absolutely packed with all the best bits. <br><br> I’ll create for you a cinematic 3-10 min
        story-driven mini-movie filled with the laughter, the love, and just the right amount of chaos that made your
        day unforgettable. Your friends and family will actually want to watch it. Not just once, but again and
        again—because it’s not just a video, it’s your story, told in a way that’s fun, authentic, and, let’s be honest,
        a little bit fabulous. <br><br> Wedding film packages start at €2000 for full-day coverage. Ready to create the
        ultimate cinematic masterpiece? Get in touch! Download below my brochure and pricing that gives you a sneak peek
        into what we can create together. <br><br> Don’t let “I wish we had a wedding film” be your biggest regret.
        Let’s make it happen!</p>

      <p class="f5-large" id="about-me-text-part1">Hi I’m Sirle, a self-confessed lover of pretty dresses, all things
        pink, stunning architecture, indulgent spas, exciting adventures, and—of course—good food (because let’s face
        it, food is pure happiness!). <br><br>
        After 19 wonderful years in the UK, I’ve recently returned to Finland and
        launched my business here—so, exciting new chapter! I started my wedding photography journey back in England
        2016 and have been telling beautiful love stories ever since. Eight years later, and I can honestly say it’s my
        absolute favourite thing to do. <br><br>
        I like to think of myself as a wedding day fairy godmother, here to
        ensure you feel fabulous, relaxed, and completely at ease while I capture all the beautiful moments that will
        become timeless memories. I pride myself on being the "ninja fly on the wall," staying out of the way while
        making sure every magical detail is preserved, so you can simply enjoy your day. <br><br>
        In my past life, that
        is life before my photography career, I worked as a model and an actress in England. My extensive experience on
        both sides of the camera is precisely the reason I am your new best friend when it comes to guidance and support
        in every way, because I know how to bring out the best in you.<br><br>
        When I’m not capturing weddings, I’m
        often working on other exciting projects. My work has been featured in publications like Town &amp; Country,
        Goop, In The Moment, and Top Santé, to name just a few. For a closer look at my other projects, and to discover
        more of what I do, you can check out my other business, Sonder Moments Media.<br><br>
        I am based in Espoo and
        have my photographic studio in Helsinki and cover destination weddings as well as weddings across the beautiful
        country of Finland. <br><br>
        If you're looking for a wedding photographer or videographer who’s as passionate
        about your special day as you are—and who’ll go above and beyond to help you shine—then look no further as I’m
        your woman!</p>

        start to finish. The zoom call set the tone and I knew we had chosen a wonderful person just from talking to
        her.She took the time to plan and talk through the day and discuss what we wanted from the video. The moment I
        met her on my wedding day I instantly felt like I had known her before and that she was a friend. She made us
        feel at ease and throughout the day. We didn’t even notice her filming. The videos are perfect. All videos have
        been edited with such care and thoughtfulness we just love the little details and how they have been matched to
        speeches making watching them so special. We cannot thank Sirle enough for her amazing videography such special
        moments and memories captured that we will cherish forever. We would highly recommend Sonder Moments Weddings
        for those wanting a professional, friendly, attention to detail videographer.</p>
